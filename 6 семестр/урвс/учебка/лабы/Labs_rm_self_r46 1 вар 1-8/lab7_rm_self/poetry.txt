I liked it better when it didn't cost innocence
Lost myself in accomplishment
And all sight of all the things that I should see
And I say

Now the judge and the jury they sit and stare
On my own without you here
Just here me out
And take a look around

I'm letting go but all I see is evidence
Of what I know everything around just don't make sense
I'm letting go but all I feel is consequence
Of what I know everything around just don't make sense

I liked it better when I thought that I was free
One on one not two on me
This blind justice it seems to have a court
And I say

I feel it coming and I take it on myself
Before i succumb to someone else
Change the ending now
And let myself break free

I'm letting go but all I see is evidence
Of what I know everything around just don't make sense
I'm letting go but all feel is consequence
Of what I know everything around just don't make sense
